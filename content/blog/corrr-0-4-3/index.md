We're thrilled to announce the release of [corrr](https://corrr.tidymodels.org/) 0.4.2. corrr is for exploring correlations in R. It focuses on creating and working with data frames of correlations (instead of matrices) that can be easily explored via corrr functions or by leveraging tools like those in the tidyverse. 

You can install it from CRAN with:


```r
install.packages("corrr")
```

This blog post will describe changes in the new version. You can see a full list of changes in the [release notes](https://corrr.tidymodels.org/news/index.html).


```r
library(corrr)
```
